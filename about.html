	<h1>Hey We're Rogues Gallery Comics and Games!</h1>
    	<p>
        	We have been the source for comics and games in the Round Rock/Williamson County area since 2001. We offer a wide variety of comics, graphic novels, board games, card games, roleplaying games, comic-themed t-shirts, and more.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
        	We carry a wide variety of comics in single issues and graphic novels. We do not have older back issues or vintage comics, due largely to space restrictions. We get new comics and graphic novels every Wednesday (they’re on the shelves when we open), and restocks on graphic novels and single issue comics on Wednesday afternoons when UPS arrives (usually by 4 PM). We always have the list of comics coming in each week on our website and Facebook page, usually by the Sunday before they arrive.

We offer an in-store subscription service that allows customers to put series or graphic novels on-hold and pick them up weekly or monthly. For details, see our In-Store Subscription link on the main page.

We do not buy or trade comics
        </p>
         <br/>
        <p>
        	We have in-store game nights four nights a week. On Monday, we host Heroclix tournaments. On some Tuesdays, we host Attack Wing tournaments. On Thursday, we host Dungeons & Dragons Encounters. On Friday, we host Friday Night Magic. And on Saturday, we play Pathfinder Adventure Card Game. In many cases, it’s a good idea to call ahead on the day of the event and reserve your spot, as some of the events do fill up. Details can be found on our event pages, linked from the main page.
