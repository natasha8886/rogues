        <div class="content">My name is Merely Ducard but I speak for Ra's al Ghul... a man greatly feared by the criminal underworld. A mon who can offer you a path. Someone like you is only here by choice. You have been exploring the criminal fraternity but whatever your original intentions you have to become truly lost. The path of a man who shares his hatred of evil and wishes to serve true justice. The path of the League of Shadows</div>
        <div class="header">Ladies Night on Wednesday, June 10th!</div>
        <div class="content">LADIES! Do you like comics? Do you like games? Do you just enjoy getting your geek on? Are you looking to make some awesome new friends? Then join us for LADIES NIGHT, hosted by our lady staff!
<br/><br/>
We will meet at Kerbey Lane Cafe this month. Meetings are on Wednesdays, and the fun kicks off at 7 and goes until around 9. We talk about all things geeky, from comics to games to movies. As adult content will most likely be discussed and as there will be alcohol present, we are making this an 18 and up event. Moms! You are welcome to bring your daughters! 15-17 is the preferred age group on that.
<br/><br/>
I would also like to add that we do not discriminate here at Rogues Gallery. If you identify as female in any way you are most welcome at our table.
<br/><br/>
Food. Booze. Good company. What more could you ask for?
<br/><br/>
We’d love it if y’all could RSVP on the Facebook event, just so we can get a rough headcount.</div>
